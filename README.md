## Code-Care-Share 
I created code-care-share app while I was training at Wild Code School during the lockdown because of Corona.
A platform where we trainees share our experiences of working and studying remotely -(the challenges, frustrations) - to support and learn from one another.  

#technologies
- reactjs
- redux to manage the state
- mongodb, nodejs and express on the backend
