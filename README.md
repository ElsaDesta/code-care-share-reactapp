## Code-Care-Share 
https://code-care-share.herokuapp.com/
I created code-care-share during the CORONA lockdown. I was doing a full-time course in Amsterdam, which turned into a remote session.
I intended to create a platform where we trainees share our experiences of working and studying remotely (the challenges, frustrations) - to support and learn from one another.
